# Explanation: HyDE Document Generation and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This document explains the provided code, which demonstrates **HyDE document generation**, **retrieval** of context, and the use of **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** for answering a given question.

---

## Overview

### Key Features:
1. **HyDE Document Generation:** Generates synthetic passages that simulate a scientific paper to address a given question.
2. **Contextual Retrieval:** Retrieves documents or context using the generated passages.
3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** Combines retrieved context and the original question to generate a detailed and accurate answer.

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. HyDE Document Generation

#### Template for Document Generation
```python
template = """Please write a scientific paper passage to answer the question
Question: {question}
Passage:"""

prompt_hyde = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```
This template guides the model to generate a scientific passage that addresses the input question. The generated passage simulates an excerpt from a scientific paper.
## 1. HyDE Chain
```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

generate_docs_for_retrieval = (
    prompt_hyde 
    | llm 
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```
- prompt_hyde: Uses the HyDE template to structure the input prompt.
- llm: Processes the prompt using a language model (e.g., ChatOpenAI).
- StrOutputParser: Converts the output from the language model into a usable string format.

### Execution
```python
question = "What is task decomposition for LLM agents?"
generate_docs_for_retrieval.invoke({"question": question})
```
1. Input: The question "What is task decomposition for LLM agents?".
2. Output: A scientific passage generated by the model, addressing the question.

## 2. Contextual Retrieval
### Retrieval Chain
```python
retrieval_chain = generate_docs_for_retrieval | retriever
retrieved_docs = retrieval_chain.invoke({"question": question})
retrieved_docs
```
1. Chain Components:
    - generate_docs_for_retrieval: Generates a synthetic passage for the question.
    - retriever: Uses the synthetic passage to query a document store or knowledge base for relevant documents.
2. Execution: Combines HyDE-generated passages with retrieval to fetch documents relevant to the input question.

### Output:

- A set of retrieved documents, providing context related to the question.

## 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
### RAG Template
```python
template = """Answer the following question based on this context:

{context}

Question: {question}
"""
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)
```
This template combines the retrieved context and the question to guide the model in generating a comprehensive answer.
### RAG Chain
```python
final_rag_chain = (
    prompt
    | llm
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```
- prompt: Creates a structured prompt combining the context and question.
- llm: Processes the prompt and generates the final answer.
- StrOutputParser: Converts the output into a structured response.

### Execution
```python
final_rag_chain.invoke({"context": retrieved_docs, "question": question})
```
1.Input:
    - context: The retrieved documents from the retrieval_chain.
    -question: The original input question.
2. Output: A detailed answer based on the context and question.

## Summary of the Workflow
### Step-by-Step Process:

1. Generate HyDE Documents:
    - Create synthetic passages simulating scientific paper excerpts that address the question.
2. Retrieve Context:
    - Use the generated passages to query a document store and retrieve relevant documents.
3. Answer Using RAG:
    - Combine the retrieved context with the original question to generate a comprehensive answer.

### Key Benefits:

- Synthetic Data for Improved Retrieval: HyDE-generated passages act as proxies for broader searches, increasing the relevance of retrieved documents.
- Enhanced Contextual Answers: By combining retrieval and generation, the system ensures answers are accurate and context-aware.

### Example Input and Output:
### Input Question:

"What is task decomposition for LLM agents?"
#### Intermediate Outputs:

1. HyDE Passage:
- A synthetic passage simulating a scientific explanation of task decomposition.
2. Retrieved Documents:
- A set of documents related to task decomposition and LLMs.

### Final Output:

A detailed and accurate response combining the retrieved context and the original question.
