It's formed when a massive star collapses in on itself and its gravity becomes so intense that it warps the fabric of spacetime around it.\n",

A black hole is similar, but instead of just warping spacetime near its center, it creates such an intense gravitational field that anything that gets too close gets pulled inexorably towards the singularity at the center.\n",

      "The point of no return around a black hole is called the event horizon. Once you cross the event horizon, you're trapped and can't escape, even if you were traveling at high speeds or had a powerful engine. It's as if the gravity of the black hole has become so strong that it's created a kind of cosmic sinkhole, where anything that gets too close gets pulled in.\n",
